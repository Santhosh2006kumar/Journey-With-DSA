# DSAHub – Structured Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Platform
DSAHub is a web-based Data Structures & Algorithms practice platform enhanced with an AI-powered chatbot to provide real-time coding assistance. The platform enables users to practice DSA problems and instantly get code solutions, time complexity, and space complexity explanations through an integrated AI interface.
# 🚀 Key Features
📚 Organized DSA problems across multiple topics
(Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.)

🤖 **AI-powered chatbot integration** for problem assistance

🔗 Dynamic problem context handling:

Clicking the **AI button** automatically passes the selected **problem title**

Navigates to the chatbot interface without manual input

💻 Generates **default Java solutions** with:

Time Complexity

Space Complexity

🔁 Supports **multi-language code generation**:

Java (default)

Python

C

🌐 Responsive and user-friendly UI for seamless navigation

# 🧠 How the AI Feature Works

1. User selects a DSA problem on the platform

2. Clicking the AI button captures the problem title dynamically

3. The title is sent to the chatbot interface

4. AI processes the context and returns:

  * Optimized code solution

  * Time & Space complexity analysis

  * Optional code in multiple programming languages
