# DSAHub – Structured Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Platform
DSAHub is a web-based Data Structures & Algorithms practice platform enhanced with an AI-powered chatbot to provide real-time coding assistance. The platform enables users to practice DSA problems and instantly get code solutions, time complexity, and space complexity explanations through an integrated AI interface.
# 🚀 Key Features
📚 Organized DSA problems across multiple topics
(Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.)

🤖 **AI-powered chatbot integration** for problem assistance

🔗 Dynamic problem context handling:

Clicking the **AI button** automatically passes the selected **problem title**

Navigates to the chatbot interface without manual input

💻 Generates **default Java solutions** with:

   * Time Complexity

   * Space Complexity

🔁 Supports **multi-language code generation**:

  * Java ( Default )
